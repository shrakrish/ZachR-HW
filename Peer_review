Your code ran pretty smoothly and there were no hurdles. 
It seems to me that instead of using simpler commands such as arrange() or filter(), you've used a bit more comlicated commands that lengthen the code. This, however is not an issue as long as you know what you're doing and are comfortable doing it!

Good luck with teh rest of the class and good job on your code!
